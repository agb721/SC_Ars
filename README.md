This SuperCollider (digital synthesis and algorithmic composition platform) code is an amalgamation of various altered patches (many taken from UdK's GenComp Seminar) and self-coded sounds. 

The original file can be thought of as divided into multiple parts: 1. the startup code, 2. the artificial rain (white noise) controlled via mouse moevements, 3. the individual sound patches, 4. an interactive harmonica to pair with an outside instrument (this part was removed because of my inability to find the original code and make attributions).
